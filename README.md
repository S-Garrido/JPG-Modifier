# JPG-Modifier

This is a tool that modifies JPG images using various filters that I made for my Object-Oriented Programming I class. The professor provided outline code and I would implement the following functions according to his specifications:

- Pixel.java
  - Pixel()
  - getData()
  - getRed()
  - getGreen()
  - getBlue()
  - equals()
- PhotoTools.java
  - isolateColor()
  - makeGrayscale()
  - makeArtistic()
  - censorIt()
  - stretched()
  - mirrorIt()
  - makeDoubleWithMirror()
